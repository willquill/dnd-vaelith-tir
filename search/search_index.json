Arughul was oppressive and cruel. His foul magic corrupted the land, poisoned its creatures and its people. Pestilence spread. Crops withered and died in the fields. Thousands starved. Mothers, unable to feed their children, abandoned them in the woods. Then arose a hero: Eagorn, who was strong, and wise, and courageous. Armed with an elven sword of great antiquity, called V\u00e6lith-Tir, Eagorn set out on a quest to free the Realm from the necromancer Arughul. On his quest, Eagorn was helped by seven strangers. In the maze-like Shadow Wood, Eagorn became lost. But there he met a halfling huntsman, who protected Eagorn from the hungry beasts of the forest, and guided him safely out from the woods. High in the treacherous Razorback Mountains, Eagorn met a dwarven blacksmith, who wrought a suit of the finest dwarven armor, to protect the hero on his journey. In the stormy Sallian Sea, Eagorn was shipwrecked, and nearly drowned. But there he met a triton fisherman, who rowed Eagorn safely to shore. In the putrid swamps of the Dirgelands, Eagorn met a tiefling witch. At first he feared the witch, but she took Eagorn in, healed his wounds with magical herbs and ointments, and gave him magic potions to lend him strength on his journey. In the stifling desert of Tamarugal, Eagorn nearly perished from the heat and thirst. But he was found by a wandering mendicant, who led Eagorn to water, and fed him from his own meager supply of bread and wine, and gave him wisdom to guide him on his quest. In the wind-blasted Delian Wastes, Eagorn nearly froze to death. But there he met a priestess of the moon, who blessed him with a spell of protection. Whenever the hero lost his way, the moon itself would guide him to his destination. And in the great human city of Temora, Eagorn met an ancient wizard. The wizard was unbound by time, and he could see into the past and into the future. He foresaw Eagorn confronting Arughul, and he gave Eagorn the insight he needed to defeat the necromancer. Finally, Eagorn and Arughul did battle atop the Tower of Kartha. The necromancer wielded dark magic, but Eagorn held the legendary sword, V\u00e6lith-Tir. Arughul was defeated, and darkness was lifted from the land. Eagorn was crowned King, and thus began a Golden Age of peace and prosperity in the Realm. Eagorn was a wise and just ruler. There were no more wars within the Realm, no more famine, nor pestilence, nor plague. King Eagorn and his loyal knights hunted Arughul's monsters and drove them from the land. King Eagorn then sent for the seven strangers who had given him aid in his quest: the huntsman, the blacksmith, the fisherman, the witch, the monk, the priestess, and the wizard. He named them dukes and duchesses, heads of the seven Noble Houses of the Realm, and entrusted them to administer the King's Justice and maintain peace in the Realm. King Eagorn knew the sword V\u00e6lith-Tir was too powerful to let fall into the wrong hands. He thought to destroy it, but feared that the dark power of Arughul might one day return to the Realm, and that V\u00e6lith-Tir might again be needed. So Eagorn broke the sword into seven pieces, and gave a piece for safekeeping to each of the Noble Houses. Seven dungeons he had built, one to hold each shard of the shattered sword. The Houses swore to guard these dungeons, and in these dungeons the shards remain to this day, in case darkness should ever return to the realm, in case V\u00e6lith-Tir should once again be called upon to deliver the Realm from evil.","title":"Game"},{"location":"game/#game","text":"","title":"Game"},{"location":"game/#lore","text":"Long ago, a dark power ruled the Realm: the necromancer, called Arughul.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
