## Backstory

Me? Some would call me a cryminal, others a folk hero. I dunna care what ye call me. I do what's right by Moradin's name. After what I seen by my own eyes all those years ago, I only knew one thing. My calling. There was divine justice that day, there was! By Sa's own crystal ball, my eyes saw the path, they did. I could judge as the Gods judged that day. We all had to. The Gods saw fit to show us our failures that they may judge for us!

I kill, aye. I steal. I been called a highwayman. I don't take pleasure innit, no. But justice must come to all. I kill those who kill. I steal from those who steal. I'm a balancer! The gods want us to judge. They showed us how. So I do.

I made more 'n a few widows. I'm hated. I'm hunted. But I'm loved too. For those with the grace of Sa know my cause is righteous. I avenge the weak, the wronged, the victims of evil. I dunna do it for the glory, no. As Torm with 'is gauntlet, I smite the wicked.

Ye may despite me. I may disgust ye. But I dunna care. I willna stop in my pursuit. I mustn't.

As for my skills, aye, I'm skilled. In survival and religion, wouldja believe it? Still alive, aren I? By grace of Sa. Ye wonna find me without my cook's utensils. A dwarf's gotta eat.

But the realm is changin', it is. I canna keep doin this much longer with the way the wind is blowin'. It's time to meet my fate. For robbin' the wrong and savin' the wronged is only half my destiny. I seek knowledge, knowledge of what happened that day and what it means for the realm. I have my suspicion, but I dunna even wanna say it outloud. The horror of what it may be shallna b'spoken.

If ye should know anything at all about anything, ye should know where the shards of Vælith-Tir are kept, safe 'n sound. But ye dunna. YE DUNNA! Ye did. We all used to. But we dunna anymore! The most righteous cause in the realm beckons me. I must see the shards safe again.

By Moradin's anvil, I shall strike down those who would see otherwise!

Whadya say, will ye have me?
