# 03 - Foxbridge

## What Happened

Waldor charged across the bridge and into the town, followed by Hammer and Harbeck.

A ruffian came out of one of the buildings and commanded us to drop our weapons.

Waldor cast a dust cloud, and chaos erupted. Everyone started fighting. We annihilated everyone except Lothar.

Lothar said he worked for Gimble, but he didn't like what Gimble was up to, so he took his crew out to Foxbridge to become bandits.

He told us that the corruption surrounds Foxbridge.

Waldor definitely takes Lothar to the build and fires a fireball at his head point blank.

Items:

- 60 copper, 26 silver, 10 gold
- 5 [gambesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambeson), burnt up
- 6 longswords (1d6, homebrew, martial weapon)
- 5 slingshots (same as what Harbeck bought)
- 1 set leather armor for a dwarf
- 1 light crossbow with 8 bolts
- 18 days of rations
- 13 torches

## Takeaway

Be wary of Waldor
